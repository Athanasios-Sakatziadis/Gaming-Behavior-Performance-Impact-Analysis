Project Description


This project investigates the relationship between gaming habits and key life indicators. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build an interactive dashboard to visualize the correlations between hours played, gaming genre preferences, and their self-reported impact on concentration, stress levels, and academic/professional performance.
